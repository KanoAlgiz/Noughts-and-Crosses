Game-Per-Month course, game #1, april '24.

During this project I've learned GDScript basics (and learned that I'll probably stick to C#. I was missing abstracts classes/interfaces, multidimensional arrays and fuller static typing support).
Probably, more valuable experience was to try writing AI first time, and, specifically, learning minimax algorithm. Debugging it was painful.
